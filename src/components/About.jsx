              Front end web developer looking to break into my first web
              development role and create life changing and meaningful web
              applications.
            </p>
            <p>
              I've recently undertaken and obtained a certificate in full stack
              development from the University of Birmingham with strong
              foundations in many languages and frameworks.
            </p>
            <p>
              Originally pursued a Mathematics degree, I'm a motivated problem
              solver who enjoys logical and analytical thinking, with a strong
              focus in mobile first design and development.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm very passionate about developing web applications to build and
              change people's lives and experiences for the better. Also open
              for new and exciting opportunities!
