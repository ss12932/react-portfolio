              Front end web developer looking to break into my first web
              development role and create life changing and meaningful web
              applications. I've recently undertaken and obtained a certificate
              in full stack development from the University of Birmingham with
              strong foundations in many languages and frameworks. Originally
              pursued a Mathematics degree, I'm a motivated problem solver who
              enjoys logical and analytical thinking, with a strong focus in
              mobile first design and development. I'm very passionate about
              developing web applications to build and change people's lives and
              experiences for the better. Also open for new and exciting
              opportunities!
